on netcup server, start bitcoin node via

$ ./src/bitcoind -v2transport -noconnect -listen -whitelist=xx.yy.0.0/16 -debug=net

Benefits

- easy experimenting with BIP324
- compact reference implementation of BIP324 (w/o distractions)
- for me: opportunity to learn rust :)
          opportunity to learn packet filters :):)

Drawbacks

- higher cpu usage / latency
  (have to do both v1+v2, go through userspace->kernelspace->userspace->kernelspace...)
- client has no awareness of the proxy; if a connection is closed,
  was that initiated by the remote node or by the proxy (e.g. due to a bug or crash)?
- can only pass through v1 messages and nothing else
  (where would we send it to? missing remote destination information), i.e. all non-v1
  messages get lost; have to be careful to *only* redirect bitcoin v1 messages to proxy
